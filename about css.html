    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to style and layout web pages. It was designed to separate the
    content of a document from its presentation, allowing web developers to create visually appealing sites without altering
    the underlying HTML structure. Introduced by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1996, CSS has become an essential tool for web design,
    enabling precise control over the look and feel of a website.
    
    One of the key features of CSS is its ability to apply styles to multiple elements simultaneously. This is achieved
    through selectors, which can target elements by their tag, class, ID, or even more complex criteria. By using cascading
    rules, where more specific rules override more general ones, CSS provides a flexible and powerful way to style web
    pages. This cascading nature gives the language its name and allows for the creation of complex designs with minimal
    code.
    
    CSS also includes a wide range of properties for controlling layout, typography, colors, backgrounds, and more. With
    properties like margin, padding, border, and display, developers can create responsive layouts that adapt to different
    screen sizes and devices. CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout modules that have revolutionized web design,
    making it easier to create sophisticated and flexible grid-based layouts.
    
    In addition to static styling, CSS supports animations and transitions, enabling developers to add dynamic effects to
    web pages. This can enhance user experience by providing visual feedback and creating a more engaging and interactive
    interface. Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow for advanced styling based on user interactions and element states,
    further enhancing the capabilities of CSS.
    
    Overall, CSS is a vital tool for any web developer or designer. It allows for the creation of beautiful, responsive, and
    user-friendly websites, separating the content from its presentation and providing a powerful, flexible way to control
    the look and feel of web pages. Understanding and mastering CSS is essential for anyone looking to build modern,
    visually appealing websites.</p>
